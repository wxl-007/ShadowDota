/*
	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
	
This script creates an extension method for the GFGrid class, which means it adds a new
method to the class without the need to alter the source code of the class. Once declared
you can use the method just like any normal class method.

One of the design principles behind Grid Framework says that the GFGrid class and all its
methods are abstract and that the exact implementation lies in the sublasses. However, since
extensions methods are static they cannot be abstract, it's simply part of the language
design of C#, so I had to do a workaround. The method performs some preperation and then
it picks the implementation based on the exact type of grid. Note that those functions are
not extension methods, they are just regular methods of this static class.
